## Natural Language Queries

Interact with your data using everyday language instead of writing complex SQL. Connect your data sources like PostgreSQL or Google Sheets, then type questions like "What were sales last quarter?" Baza Analytics translates them into optimized queries.

  const dashboardId = 'dash-12345';
  const embedUrl = `https://app.bazaanalytics.com/embed/${dashboardId}?token=YOUR_TOKEN`;

  embedIframe(embedUrl);
  ```
  ```python
  import requests

  dashboard_id = "dash-12345"
  token = "YOUR_TOKEN"
  embed_url = f"https://app.bazaanalytics.com/embed/{dashboard_id}?token={token}"
  print(embed_url)
  ```
</CodeGroup>
